# Remove Amazon History Chrome Extension

Amazon removed the button to clear all browsing history at once. This extension adds back the function to bulk remove the history.

This extension gives you one button to remove all the items that show up on the history page. By scrolling down and clicking the button multiple times, you can easily clear the entire history.
